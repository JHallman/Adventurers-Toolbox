# Adventurer's Toolbox

   Adventurer's Toolbox is a mod that allows for the creation of custom tools and weapons from a variety of different parts. The aim is for all the tools and materials to be balanced against vanilla, to avoid adding unnecessary or unrelated content, to maintain decent mod compatibility, and to keep things as simple as possible.
   
   To that end, there is nothing else in this mod besides the tools, the tool parts, the guide book, and rocks, which are like gold or iron nuggets, but for cobblestone. All tools and parts are made with the vanilla crafting table, and although the mod adds no new materials, it allows for tools and tool parts to be made with a number of common materials from other mods.

   To get started in-game, just craft any tool head to receive the guidebook.
